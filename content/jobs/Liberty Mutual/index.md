<h4> Model Deployment - MLOps </h4>
I was heavily involved in helping engineers create an enterprise standard for DS model deployment.

- Tools used include Airflow/Luigi, MLflow, Flask, Docker, Bamboo and Artifactory, AWS Fargate, DataDog and Splunk
- Also helped explore bringing more innovation solutions like Seldon to solve challenges like inference graphs and AB deployments
- In partnership with various business teams and data scientists, the models I am responsible for helping deploy create an estimate of $10m+ in annual value.

<h4> Aerial Imagery </h4>

- Created a sustainable and efficent pipeline for tile architecture, using async calls for fast inference as well as image processing for thousands of addresses. Project worth ~ 1m annually.

<h4> Additional </h4>

- Supported enterprise NLP efforts for extracting information from emails using NLP
- Prototyped claims fraud analytics / modeling using Neo4j
- I was a manager for co-ops, and led development on deploying a NLP model for email triage (estimated 100k+ annual value).
