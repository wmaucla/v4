I returned back to Liberty Mutual to join the Office of Data Science, a center of DS enterprise excellence.

- Helped create an enterprise standard for DS model deployment / MLOps by using and experimenting with various tools (Airflow, MLflow, Seldon, ...)
- Built an async pipeline for DSM tiles (computer vision) for faster image processing
- Supported enterprise NLP efforts for extracting information from emails using NLP (transformer models)
- Helped prototype graph claims fraud analytics / modeling using Neo4j
- I was a manager for co-ops, and helped deploy a NLP model for email triage (estimated 100k+ annual value)
