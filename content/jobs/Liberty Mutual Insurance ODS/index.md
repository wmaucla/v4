- I built a pipeline for DSM tiles (computer vision) using async for faster image processing
- I supported enterprise NLP efforts for extracting information from emails using NLP (transformer models)
- I helped prototype graph claims fraud analytics / modeling using Neo4j
- I was a manager for co-ops, and helped deploy a NLP model for email triage (estimated 100k+ annual value)
