I worked for Solaria Labs, the innovation arm of Liberty Mutual.

- My main project included an end-to-end python ETL pipeline for processing / analyzing telematics data using dask, luigi, spark, webscraping, and geospatial processing
- I also developed a ML pipeline (>100GB of data) to create a model for a Driver Risk Score
- Various smaller projects include mask RCNN (computer vision) for detecting license plates and pools from satellite imagery and experimental design for testing extractive summaries on audio transcripts
