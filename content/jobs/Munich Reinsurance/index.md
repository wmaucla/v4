I worked for Integrated Analytics, focused on innovation in life & disability insurance.

- I worked on MAPS, ML for Attending Physician Statements, which leverages a Question/Answer transformer model (NLP) and is pipelined with Airflow / dockerized. Please see [here](https://www.munichre.com/us-life/en/perspectives/underwriting/integrating-machine-learning-efficient-underwriting-attending-physician-statements-records.html) for more information.
- OCR experimentation using Tesseract, OpenCV, Calamari, and ABBYY to produce higher quality OCR
- I also built an end-to-end DL entity resolution application, pipelined with luigi and deployed with flask on Azure. Based on the [Deepmatcher](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher) project
