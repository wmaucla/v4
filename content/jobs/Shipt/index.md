I am currently working with [Shipt](https://www.shipt.com/shop) as a ML Engineer. I'm part of the ML platform team, focusing on building a feature store that is currently being used by DS teams and based on the [feast](https://feast.dev/) project. If you check out my readings on my Zotero, don't be surprised if you see a ton about feature stores!
