I worked at [Shipt](https://www.shipt.com/shop) as a Senior ML Engineer on the ML Platform team, and as a Senior Engineer working on the DevOps Delivery team. My focus was developing out Shipt's internal ML platform tools and technologies, including but not limited to:

- Building an internal feature store that is currently being used by DS teams and based on the [feast](https://feast.dev/) project
- Updating and managing internal ML predictions infrastructure (kafka/spark/snowflake)
- GCP bucket DAG sync for Airflow (helm/terraform/kubernetes) using a sidecar pattern
- Prototyping / evaluating new patterns using Seldon, Kubeflow, Cassandra
