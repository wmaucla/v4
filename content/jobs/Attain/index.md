I'm currently at Attain, a fintech/adtech startup as a technical lead for MLOps and ML Engineering related initiatives.

Here are some quick highlights:

- Offshore manager and project manager
- Optimized machine learning workflows within a set budget by adjusting batch training and inference strategies to prevent exceeding the allocated spend
- Introduced GPU-based model training and integrated GPUs into internal GKE clusters to accelerate ML workloads
- Evaluated self-hosted model APIs versus Vertex AI Endpoints, optimizing for performance and cost efficiency
- Implemented drift detection to address feature drift in production data
- Converted ML model training + inference into Julia for optimized performance
